    abstract={By late 2004, Scrum had been chosen independently as a development process by several teams at Amazon.com. From then until 2009, Scrum spread to a large portion of the software development teams at Amazon. This widespread adoption occurred in part due to the actions of a single individual and in part due to the natural match between Scrumpsilas characteristics and the culture prevalent at Amazon.com. Widespread use of small, independent teams and a general empowerment at the team level made Scrum a smaller step to take for development teams at Amazon than it would be at many companies of equal or greater size. The success of Scrum at Amazon shows how important the prevailing culture of the company can be in terms of supporting an Agile transformation. These lessons are relevant to Scrum transformations being undertaken at many companies today.}

    volume={6759 LNCS},
    pages={30-43},
    abstract={To respond to the need for flexibility in reacting to customer needs, the agile practices have been introduced in the software development organizations. In order to get full benefit of agile, it is proposed that the agile and lean practices should be adopted organization wide. Agile practices are mainly used by programmers, but in large companies, there can be different work roles and tasks which do not directly include programming of the product but are supporting the software development in the system level, such as system level testing and testing environment maintenance. In this study, the goal was to provide information on the progress of agile transformation in teams with no direct programming responsibility in a large-scale, distributed software development organization. A survey was done to collect data during the first year of agile adoption about agile practices utilisation within three different teams: the developers, the system level testers and people in test laboratory support. The results show that certain agile practices were adopted in the teams with no direct programming responsibility, and there were differences between the teams. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

    booktitle={Agile Development Conference, 2004},
    pages={2-10},
    abstract={Agile development practices respect tacit knowledge, makes communication more effective, and thus fosters the knowledge creation process. However the current agile methods, like XP, are focused on practices that individual teams or projects need, and the use of the methods in organizations consisting of multiple cooperating teams is difficult. The community of practice theory suggests that large agile organizations should have various overlapping, informal cross-team communities. This paper studies three agile methods developed at Nokia that use facilitated workshops to solve multiteam issues. The paper explains using communities of practices theory - why these methods work in multiteam settings. The results of this paper suggest that workshop practices that amass people from different parts of organizations to perform a specific well-defined task can be used effectively to solve issues that span over multiple teams and to build up communities of practice. This result suggests that the community of practice concept could provide a basis for adapting agile methods for the needs of large organizations.}

    abstract={Agile software development methods and techniques have been demonstrated to improve employee morale, enhance end-product quality, and achieve customer satisfaction. Agile adoption always comes with special challenges and thus fundamental organizational changes are necessary for successful outcome. In this paper we present an in-depth case study for adopting Scrum in a multi-team and multi-project situation to a government entity in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E). While there are many successful stories for adopting Scrum in large and small organizations, there is little known about adoption stories in a multi-project/multi-team environments. In this paper we present a case study for an unsuccessful adoption of Scrum in a government entity in the U.A.E. The government entity under study have used the traditional waterfall approach for many years and decided to move to Agile software development method. This study highlights the challenges faced during the adoption of Scrum method with recommendations to address them. Each organization has its unique properties and one case study is not enough to draw conclusions for the U.A.E environment. However, the results obtained from this paper help software engineers to better understand the development environment and context factors for software projects in the U.A.E and many lessons may be learned for future Agile adoption. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

    abstract={In large, traditional software development projects, the number of defects can be considerably high. Agile methods promise code quality improvement, but while embracing the agile methods, software development organizations have realized that defects still do exist and must be managed. When the development is distributed over several sites, defect management can become even more challenging. In this study we analyzed defect data in a large multi-site organization during the first twelve months of their agile transformation. Complementing information was gathered by a survey, which was conducted in the organization twice: after six and after twelve months of starting the agile transformation. The results indicate that the defect reporting practices changed after the agile adoption was started, the defect inflow was more stable and the defect closing speed improved.}

	abstract={Agile methods are a departure from plan-driven traditional approaches, where the focus is on generating early releases of working software using collaborative techniques, code refactoring, and on-site customer involvement. Research and surveys have shown that agile methodologies are an efficient way of producing software with significant advantages in production costs, time-to-market, complexity, and quality improvement over heavy-weight traditional methodologies. Even with such apparent advantages the information technology industry has not seen large-scale adoption of agile methods. In this survey paper, the major challenges in adopting agile practices by enterprises are addressed. Drawing information from the literature issues like framework for agile organizational change and adoption strategies are examined. Inputs from the industry suggest that most organizations are best suited in adopting a combination of traditional and agile methods. There is no agile methodology that can be universally applied and they all have to be tailored to integrate into existing processes. (Author abstract)},

The effective adoption of Agile requires passionate, motivated individuals who accept change, think like a business owner, operate willingly outside team walls, and identify and drive program issues. Finding such a large number of people with these qualities is much more difficult than establishing methods to support communications, progress tracking, and other agile practices.

    abstract={Agile software development methods mainly aim at increasing software quality by fostering customer collaboration and performing exhaustive testing. The introduction of Extreme Programming (XP) - the most common agile software development method - into an organization is accompanied with conceptual and organizational changes. These changes range from daily-life changes (e.g., sitting together and maintaining an informative project environment) and continue with changes on the management level (e.g., meeting and listening to the customer during the whole process and the concept of the whole team which means that all role holders are part of the team). This paper examines the process of transition to an agile development process in a large-scale software project in the Israeli Air Force as it is perceived from the system analysis and design perspective. Specifically, the project specifications of the agile team are compared with those of a team who continues working according to the previous heavyweight method during the first half year of transition. Size and complexity measures are used as the basis of the comparison. In addition to the inspection of the specifications, the change in the role of the system analysts, as the system analysts conceive of it, is examined.},

    journal={Empirical Software Engineering},
    volume={15},
    number={6},
    pages={654-693},
    abstract={So far, only few in-depth studies focused on the direct comparison of process models in general, and between plan-driven and incremental/agile approaches in particular. That is, it is not made explicit what the effect is of moving from one model to another model. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on advantages and issues encountered in agile software development, this is specifically true in the context of large-scale development. The objective of the paper is to investigate how the perception of bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and rework (from hereon referred to as issues) changes when migrating from a plan-driven to an incremental software development approach with agile practices (flexible product backlog, face-to-face interaction, and frequent integration), and how commonly perceived these practices are across different systems and development roles. The context in which the objective should be achieved is large-scale development with a market-driven focus. The selection of the context was based on the observation in related work that mostly small software development projects were investigated and that the investigation was focused on one agile model (eXtreme programming). A case study was conducted at a development site of Ericsson AB, located in Sweden in the end of 2007. In total 33 interviews were conducted in order to investigate the perceived change when migrating from plan-driven to incremental and agile software development, the interviews being the primary source of evidence. For triangulation purposes measurements collected by Ericsson were considered, the measurements relating to unnecessary work (amount of discarded requirements) and rework (data on testing efficiency and maintenance effort). Triangulation in this context means that the measurements were used to confirm the perceived changes with an additional data source. In total 64 issues were identified, 24 being of general nature and the remaining 40 being local and therefore unique to individuals opinions or a specific system. The most common ones were documented and analyzed in detail. The commonality refers to how many persons in different roles and across the systems studied have mentioned the issues for each of the process models. The majority of the most common issues relates to plan-driven development. We also identified common issues remaining for agile after the migration, which were related to testing lead-time, test coverage, software release, and coordination overhead. Improvements were identified as many issues commonly raised for the plan-driven approach were not raised anymore for the incremental and agile approach. It is concluded that the recent introduction (start in 2005 with the study being conducted in the end of 2007) of incremental and agile practices brings added values in comparison to the plan-driven approach, which is evident from the absence of critical issues that are encountered in plan-driven development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

    abstract={Adopting Agile takes courage, perseverance, and continued reinforcement. To meet these needs, a community of Agile coaches organically emerged at capital one to provide support and mentoring for projects and organizations seeking to adopt Agile. The community has evolved into an influential body of change agents, which routinely meets to address team or organizational initiatives in Agile projects across the enterprise. By creating an environment where true community can exist and grow, we have added sustainability to our Agile adoption processes and enabled continuous innovation of practices and principles.}

    abstract={Youpsilare the executive sponsor of your divisionpsilas foray into agile development. It was successful with the first development team; you saw very good results with the second and third; by the fourth team you knew you had something really successful going on. Now you want to roll it out across the entire engineering organization. But therepsilas a problem: each of your teams approaches agile a little differently. Youpsilad like a consistent approach across the division for a number of reasons, but you donpsilat want to stifle the new culture of cooperation and coordination that agile has brought to the organization. You have four different teams doing agile successfully four different ways. How do you scale agile across the organization with a consistent approach that also supports The Manifesto? We successfully scaled agile across a large development organization using strong, and very active, executive sponsorship to complement agile team discipline; by laying out a set of clearly defined, non- negotiable conventions and regulations, practices and expectations; and by training ourselves to constantly and consistently enforce, and question, these conventions from within.}

    abstract={Can Agile approaches be used successfully in large organizations, where traditional methods and high levels of governance are the norm? Although the iterative, agile approaches have been seen to work well in small, flexible organizations, or on smaller projects, they frequently fall foul of the larger organization's need for governance, investment appraisal and control. Formed in 1967, OCLC develops software for use by libraries and their users, museums, and academic institutions. Researchers, students, faculty, scholars, professional librarians and other information seekers use OCLC services to obtain bibliographic, abstract and full-text information. OCLC aims to be the leading global library cooperative. More than 54,000 libraries in 96 countries and territories around the world use OCLC services to locate, acquire, catalog, lend and preserve library materials. This paper examines how TCC, a training and consultancy company from Cheshire, England has worked with OCLC, the Online Computer Library Center based in Dublin, Ohio to incorporate the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) into a development culture that was deeply-rooted in "traditional" software development methods. Examples from multiple projects illustrate how the adoption of DSDM helped OCLC change its culture and achieve success in software development and deployment. OCLC's TLC dashboard was used to track the effectiveness of the development cycle, and to collect metrics from 2003 to the present. We discuss some of the challenges we faced and the six agile steps to success. © 2006 IEEE.}
